# Flux Spack

This is a testing repository for ideas to:

1. Perform automated builds at some frequency to ensure flux packages build with spack
2. To keep a build cache that can make this more speedy.
3. To have a process for updating versions on new releases (via some other trigger)
4. To keep package recipes here, and automatically update upstream spack

**under development**
