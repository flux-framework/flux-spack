# Flux Spack

**NOTE** this will soon be deprecated in favor of [https://github.com/flux-framework/spack/](https://github.com/flux-framework/spack/), which has the same content alongside a spack install on the develop branch. Actions have been disabled here.

This is a testing repository for ideas to:

1. Perform automated builds at some frequency to ensure flux packages build with spack
2. To keep a build cache that can make this more speedy.
3. To have a process for updating versions on new releases (via some other trigger)
4. To keep package recipes here, and automatically update upstream spack

**under development**
